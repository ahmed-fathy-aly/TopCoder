As usual in math contests, there is going to be a problem that involves an abstract machine of sorts and predicting how will it process a sequence of colored balls. This time, the machine will use the balls as a special language that works as follows: The process begins when the machine is given a stack of balls that are colored either white or black. The next steps are as follows:<br></br>
<ul><li>Take the top ball out of the stack, show it to the audience and discard it.</li>
<li>If the taken ball was white, the contents of the stack will be dumped into a new stack and the new stack will be used in the next step. In other words, the order of the balls in the stack will be reversed.</li>
<li>If the taken ball was black, the balls inside the stack will get their colors inverted. Every originally-white ball will turn black and every originally-black ball will turn white.</li>
<li>The process is repeated until there are no balls left in the stack.</li>
</ul>
You have been hired to make a program to grade the answers to this contest question. Given the contents of the stack, return the number of black balls that will be shown to the audience. Due to limitations in the input size, the contents of the stack are given by String <b>ballSequence</b>, and int <b>repetitions</b>. To form the sequence of balls, repeat <b>ballSequence</b> <b>repetitions</b> times. The final sequence will contain 'B' and 'W' characters denoting a black or a white ball respectively from the top of the stack to the bottom.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Definition</h3></td></tr><tr><td>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</td><td><table><tr><td>Class:</td><td>MathContest</td></tr><tr><td>Method:</td><td>countBlack</td></tr><tr><td>Parameters:</td><td>String, int</td></tr><tr><td>Returns:</td><td>int</td></tr><tr><td>Method signature:</td><td>int countBlack(String ballSequence, int repetitions)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">(be sure your method is public)</td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Limits</h3></td></tr><tr><td>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</td><td><table><tr><td>Time limit (s):</td><td>2.000</td></tr><tr><td>Memory limit (MB):</td><td>64</td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Constraints</h3></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top">-</td><td><b>ballSequence</b> will contain between 1 and 50 characters, inclusive.</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top">-</td><td>Each character in <b>ballSequence</b> will be 'B' or 'W'.</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top">-</td><td><b>repetitions</b> will be between 1 and 3500, inclusive.</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top">-</td><td>The total number of balls after generating the sequence will be between 1 and 100000, inclusive.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Examples</h3></td></tr><tr><td align="center" nowrap="true">0)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</td><td><table><tr><td><table><tr><td><pre>&quot;BBWWB&quot;</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>1</pre></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><pre>Returns: 2</pre></td></tr><tr><td><table><tr><td colspan="2">The starting contents of the stack from top to bottom are: BBWWB.
