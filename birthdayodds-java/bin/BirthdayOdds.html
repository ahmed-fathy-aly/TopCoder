Given two integers (<b>minOdds</b> and <b>daysInYear</b>), your method should return the fewest number of people (from a planet where there are <b>daysInYear</b> days in each year) needed such that you can be at least <b>minOdds</b>% sure that two of the people have the same birthday. See example 0 for further information.</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Definition</h3></td></tr><tr><td>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</td><td><table><tr><td>Class:</td><td>BirthdayOdds</td></tr><tr><td>Method:</td><td>minPeople</td></tr><tr><td>Parameters:</td><td>int, int</td></tr><tr><td>Returns:</td><td>int</td></tr><tr><td>Method signature:</td><td>int minPeople(int minOdds, int daysInYear)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">(be sure your method is public)</td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Limits</h3></td></tr><tr><td>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</td><td><table><tr><td>Time limit (s):</td><td>2.000</td></tr><tr><td>Memory limit (MB):</td><td>64</td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Notes</h3></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top">-</td><td>Two people can have the same birthday without being born in the same year.</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top">-</td><td>You may assume that the odds of being born on a particular day are (1 / <b>daysInYear</b>).</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top">-</td><td>You may assume that there are no leap years.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Constraints</h3></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top">-</td><td><b>minOdds</b> will be between 1 and 99, inclusive.</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top">-</td><td><b>daysInYear</b> will be between 1 and 10000, inclusive.</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top">-</td><td>For any number of people N, the odds that two people will have the same birthday (in a room with N people, on a planet with <b>daysInYear</b> days in each year) will not be within 1e-9 of <b>minOdds</b>.

This is equivalent to saying that the odds of everyone having different birthdays is 25% or less.</p>

<ol><li>If there is only one person in the room, the odds are 5/5 or 100% that nobody shares a birthday.</li>
<li>If there are two people in the room, the odds are 5/5 * 4/5 = 80% that nobody shares a birthday. This is because the second person has 4 &quot;safe&quot; days on which his birthday could fall, out of 5 possible days in the year.</li>
<li>If there are three people in the room, the odds of no overlap are 5/5 * 4/5 * 3/5 = 48%.</li>
<li>If there are four people in the room, the odds are 5/5 * 4/5 * 3/5 * 2/5 = 19.2%. This means that you can be (100% - 19.2%) = 80.8% sure that two or more of them do, in fact, have the same birthday.</li></ol>

<p>We only need to be 75% sure of this, which was untrue for three people but true for four.
